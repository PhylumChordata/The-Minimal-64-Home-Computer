# The-Minimal-64-Home-Computer
Here is my take on 80's home computer magic: My design of a "dream home computer", the Minimal 64. To me its the most computer from the least logic or the shortest way from TTL to Space Invaders. Have fun!

● Simple 'Von-Neumann' architecture, 8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus
● 128 instructions including conditional branching, subroutines, stack and word operations
● 64KB RAM, 512KB FLASH SSD with file system (format, load, save, dir, delete)
● VGA output 400 x 240 pixels, monochrome
● PS/2 keyboard, expansion & serial port
● 8MHz clock rate, CPU @ 6MHz with 0.84Mips =

● 4 data registers A, B, X, Y
● ALU supporting ADD, SUBTRACT, NOT, AND, OR, XOR
● 3 flags (negative, carry and zero)
● 24 control signals
● 61 TTL chips (only 74HCxx logic, 6C1008 SRAM, 39SF0x0 FLASH)

● Full native tool-chain: OS, text editor, assembler, Python-like language interpreter
● Games (Tetris, Invaders)
● Emulator and cross-assembler (Windows 10)
