# The-Minimal-64-Home-Computer

Here is my take on 80's home computer magic: The most computer from the least logic or the shortest way from TTL to Space Invaders.

NEW: Open-source emulators written in JAVA/PROCESSING and JAVASCRIPT/p5.js https://editor.p5js.org/slu4coder/full/aOUivViNt available now!

● Clean 'Von-Neumann' architecture, 8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus, 24 control signals

● 64KB RAM, 512KB FLASH SSD with file system (format, load, save, dir, delete)

● Monochrome VGA output 400 x 240 pixels, PS/2, expansion and serial UART ports

● 8MHz system clock, 6MHz CPU clock with 0.84Mips (2x Commodore 64)

● Only 61 TTL chips (74HCxx logic, 6C1008 SRAM, 39SF0x0 FLASH)

● 128 instructions including conditional branching, subroutines, stack and word operations

● 4 data registers A, B, X, Y

● ALU supporting ADD, SUBTRACT, NOT, AND, OR, XOR with 3 flags (negative, carry and zero)

● Full native tool-chain: MinOS, text editor, assembler, fast Python-like interpreter 'MIN'

● Emulator, cross-assembler (for Windows only) and classic games (TETRIS clone, Space Invaders clone)
