This is a portable 'Java/Processing' version of the 'Minimal 64 Home Computer' emulator.

The emulator is using German keyboard layout. For customizing do the following:

o Uncomment the first line of the 'keyPressed()' function: println(keyCode);
o Press and note Processing 4's keyCodes as shown in the console window.
o Identify the corresponding PS2 scan codes in the provided map 'PS2_Scancodes_Set_2.png'.
o Update the pre-defined 'keyScancodePairs' entries.

Have fun!
